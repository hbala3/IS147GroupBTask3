Paragraph describing problem that your project is solving:
Our project is an online banking system which aims to solve the problem of inefficiency and inconvenience in traditional banking systems. The system will consist of different financial aspects including creating an online account, opening a checking account, depositing cash, withdrawing money, and checking balance. Our system will provide a simple and secure platform where users can complete a number of tasks. We hope this can make it easier for people to access their bank accounts from anywhere at any time.

End 




Group Project Task 3: Use of Docker

Docker is an application that lets you build, ship, and run containerized applications in lightweight and portable containers. Some of the basic uses of Docker are application deployment, development and testing, microservices architecture, and continuous integration. Docker makes applications consistent and easy to deploy anywhere.




Group Project Task 4: Use of Docker and GitHub Action

Our project uses Docker to create a consistent and portable environment for building and running the application across differet systems. GitHub Actions is implemented to help with handling tasks such as testing, building Docker images, and deploying updates when changes are pushed to the repository. Overall Docker and GitHub Actions are used to enhance development and deployment efficiency.




Group Project Task 5: Use of JavaDocs

In our project, JavaDocs are used to provide clear and structured documentation for all classes and methods that make up our Banking System. They describe what each part of the system does--such as creating accounts, depositing money, withdrawing funds, and checking balances.JavaDocs makes the system easier to maintain, update, and extend in the future.
