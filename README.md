Paragraph describing problem that your project is solving:
Our project is an online banking system which aims to solve the problem of inefficiency and inconvenience in traditional banking systems. The system will consist of different financial aspects including creating an online account, opening a checking account, depositing cash, withdrawing money, and checking balance. Our system will provide a simple and secure platform where users can complete a number of tasks. We hope this can make it easier for people to access their bank accounts from anywhere at any time.
